      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up in the small town of Carvahall, I was raised only by my grandfather, and without an idea as to the
        identities of my mother or father.
        As we were a small household (between myself, my brother, and my grandfather), we scraped by through hunting in
        the wilderness.
        One day, while out on a hunt, I came across a dragon's egg, which I brought home and hatched!
        Over time, we were able to establish a mental connection that allowed sharing thoughts, feelings, and even
        sights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the extremely oppressive government got wind of the egg's location and came after it via the
        Ra'zac, a vile species that imitates humans to get close to them and eat their flesh & bone marrow. They killed my grandfather
        and burned down my house, forcing me to chase after them in an effort to get vengence and train to become a true
        dragon rider and free all the people of the aforementioned oppressive government.
