      <h2>My Tutelage under Brom</h2>
      <p>My favorite class under Brom was learning magic in an informal setting, accomplishing simple tasks, such as
        lifting stones, and making explosions</p>
      <aside role="note">
        <p>
          My favorite memory with Brom was when he would tell me stories about the times before when Galbatorix had
          taken over the world, as we knew it.

      <h2>My Tutelage under Oromis</h2>
      <p>
        My favorite class under Oromis was watching nature and learning to listen to all the thoughts of the insects and
        animals around me to gain a greater appreciation for life and be able to surveil everyone's intentions around
        me.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
          My favorite memory with Oromis was when he helped me understand why we faught against the empire when doing so
          would bring about a significant amount of suffering (it was more than the suffering brought about by the
          existing government, and due to the dictator's infinite lifespan, it couldn't end without someone rising up
          against him).
