        <h1>My Battle Against Galbatorix</h1>
        <p>
            Battling Galbatorix, for me, began when I defied the Ra'zac.
            Although it was unlikely that Galbatorix took offense at my actions, my later slaughter of Urgals under his
            banner cemented this position. Shortly after, he confirmed my suspicions when he posted "Wanted" posters of
            me throughout the empire, alongside those of my cousin.
        </p>

        <p>
            This left me with no other option besides joining his elusive enemies, The Varden. They took me under their
            wings and taught me the history Galbatorix had sought to wipe out. Through them, I was able to practice
            fighting against the best of the resistance fighters, and even learn some magic from some twins.
        </p>

        <p>
            When Galbatorix found out that I had joined his enemies, he sent his Urgals and a Shade to take me by force
            by attacking the home of The Varden. We managed to just stave off the attack and I eventually made my way to
            the elves, to continue my resistance against Galbatorix's tyranny.
        </p>

        <p>
            Under the elves, I found that I was not actually the last rider alive and was able to learn many secrets of
            magic, fighting, and character from one of the last of the riders. Ultimately, when Galbatorix continued
            attacking The Varden and their supporters in Surda, I had no other option but to finish my tutelage and
            support them in their efforts to fight against the empire.
        </p>

        <p>
            During many skirmishes between our forces and the empire, I mostly used magic to keep our resistance
            fighters safe from enemy magicians. However, one battle, a new rider appeared and attacked us. We soon
            learned that this was a former ally, who had been turned against us, against his own will! Only through
            combining our power with Oromis and other elves, were we able to repel his attempts to kidnap us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ultimately, we got the capital city, where we were able to battle Galbatorix himself directly. When the
            situation became dire, we became extremely frustrated and used the power of magic to force him to experience
            the pain of all the people he'd hurt over his immense lifetime, causing him to explode, winning the battle.
